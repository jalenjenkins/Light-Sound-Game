## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[I did not use any outside resources to help complete my submission.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[The biggest challenge I encountered in creating this submission was time. I found out about the SITE program the week that the prework was due, 
and here at Cornell University I have been swamped with assignments, exams, and quizzes making up a very demanding workload. Additionally, I was 
exposed to COVID-19 recently, which took a lot of time away from my prework, as well as my studies. Right now it is about two weeks after 
the submission deadline, and I feel as though the only way I have been able to overcome this issue of time is to make more time. Besides my 
current situation, I think the biggest challenge that I took on was making sure I didn’t change the game TOO much with my ideas. In question number 
four (which I chose to write before writing my answer to this question), you will see that if time permitted, I would add many features to the game. 
However, what you may not realize is that the features I would add would not compromise the original goal of the game. The game is meant to be a “light 
& sound memory game.” Meaning the essence of the game is testing the user’s memory with light and sounds. There were some features that I came 
up with, like some sort of hint system that would assist the user in knowing what button to press, for instance, that I chose not to include 
because I felt that it would compromise the objective of the game. To overcome this creative difficulty, what I did when brainstorming features 
to add to the game, I made sure to write down the objective of the game on loose leaf paper, and a very basic skeleton of pseudo code so I would not 
stray too far away from the objective.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[The only questions that I have for web development come more on the backend side. My biggest one, is what could I do to make a game that involves 
two players on different devices. It was in my plans to make the game multiplayer, but with my current developing ability, I believe I could only 
make it so that two people on the same device could play together. I would really like to learn more about backend development and delve further 
into the world of servlets. Aside from backend specific questions, I would also like to know more about data storage in case I wanted to have some 
sort of scoring system in the future. For example, I would like to know what it takes to keep track of a user’s high scores, and possibly store a 
user’s top three scores in the game.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would more than likely use the time to change the appearance of the game, and also make it more 
user friendly. In changing the appearance, I would have used a navigation bar that would take the user to different projects I plan on creating in 
the near future, such as a java game, an old python Space Invaders game I created, and a currency conversion tool. I would change the layout of the 
sound buttons as well. I would add more game buttons, as well as links to my social media profiles, Github profile, as well as my Linkedin page. I 
would also import some mp3 files and change the sounds to more current recognizable noises from either some TikToks, or old vines. I also would have 
made sure to make the playback of sounds random. Additionally, I would have loved to add a difficulty feature, that would allow the user to choose between 
beginner, intermediate, and expert, with each increasingly difficult level consisting of more sounds to play, requiring a faster response time, and 
a more exact window of how long each button should be pressed to match the playback. Another idea I had to make the game more difficult, would be to 
change the sounds to recordings of different colors, with each button playing a color of a different button. The last function I would have liked to add
would be the possibility of making the game multiplayer, and having a user play the original tones, and another user must be able to match the playback 
of the first user to win.]
